    <h2>What is git?</h2>
    <p class="m-paragraph">
      Git is a version control system. A version control sysytem is a tool
      used to track and manage changes over time. A (VCS) is divided into
      two:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Centralized version control system</li>
      <li>Decentralized version control system</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="s-paragraph">Git is useful to its users in different ways. Its used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Track changes</li>
      <li>Collaborate with others on projects</li>
      <li>Revert back to old versions or forms</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Installing git</h3>
    <p class="m-paragraph">
      Let's get practical!<br/>
      First, check whether git is already installed in your machine. To do
      this, open your terminal or command prompt from the start menu or from
      searching manually. <br>
      Then, run <span class="code"><code>git --version</code></span>.<br> 
      This will tell you
      the version of git you are using. if it doesn't, use this:
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git Download</a> to
      download git into your machine. Afterwards run the command( <span class="code"><code>git --version</code></span> ).
    </p>

  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Configuring git</h3>
    <p class="m-paragraph">
      One downðŸš€, many to go! <br/>
      At this point, i am assuming you already have git installed, now lets have it <b>configured</b>.
    </p> 
    <p class="m-paragraph">
      Let us start with the username. <br>
      To configure the username, run: <br>
      <span class="code">
        <code>git config --global user.name "your preferred username"</code>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="m-paragraph">
      To configure your email address, run<br>
      <code>git config --global user.email "your email address"</code><br/>
      Confirming whether these two have been configured is very easy. Just
      run the following:<br>
      <span class="code">
          <code>
            git config user.name<br>
            git config user.email
          </code>
      </span>
    </p>
     

    <figure>
      <img src="./images/configuring git.png" alt="configuring git" width="600px" />

    </figure>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Initializing a git repository</h3>
    <p class="m-paragraph">
      Now that we have git installed and configured with our email and our
      username, lets initialize a git repository. Think of a git
      repository as a <b>folder</b> that we track all of our changes.
      There are two types of a git repo, a local repository and a remote
      repository. A local repository is the one that exists in your
      computer while the remote one is the one online in sites like
      github.
    </p>
    <p class="s-paragraph">
      Lets initialize. <br />
      Go to the folder you want to have your project and run the terminal.
      <br />
      To initialize a git repo, run <span class="code"><code>git status</code></span> first to confirm
      there is no existing repository. You should only have one git
      repository for your project. <br />
      Now run <span class="code"><code>git init</code></span> to initialize a git repository.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./images/initializing.png" alt="running git status and git init to initialize a git repo"
        width="600px" />
      <figcaption>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="s-paragraph">
    You can confirm by again running <span class="code"><code>git status</code></span>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Adding files to the staging area</h3>
    <p class="m-paragraph">
      You are doing amazing! now we need to add files to the staging area.
      Think of the staging area like a waiting room, your code stays there
      waiting to be admitted. To do this, we use
      <span class="code"><code>git add filename</code></span> e.g. <b>git add text.txt</b>
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./images/adding files.png" alt="A screenshot of adding files to the staging area" width="600px" />
      <figcaption>Adding files to the staging area</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="m-paragraph">
      From the screenshot above, you can see that when we added the .txt
      file it was ready for commit and it was in green, that is a tracked
      file meaning that it is now being monitored by git while the .html file was red until we added it to the
      staging area.When it was red it was an untracked file, meaning git is not monitoring them. You can also
      use
      <span class="code"><code>git add .</code></span> to shorten the whole process and make it easier.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Commiting changes</h3>
    <p class="m-paragraph">
      We are almost done here. Commiting is like 'saving' the changes you
      added earlier. To commit you need to use
      <span class="code"><code>git commit -m "commit message"</code></span>. For the 'commit messages'
      should answer, <b>'What will this commit do?'.</b> For example git commit -m
      "Add our files to..."
    </p>

      <figcaption>A commit command and the expected result</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="s-paragraph">
      It is also possible to view all of our past commits. We use...<br>
      <span class="code"><code>git log</code></span>
    </p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="./images/past-commits.png" alt="a screenshot of all our past commits" width="600px" />

    <p class="s-paragraph">
      And just like that we are done with that part!
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="branch">
    <div>
      <h2>Branches</h2>
      <p class="s-paragraph">
        In a nutshell, branching helps in creating a <b>copy of a file</b> without
        messing the original file. Branching can be used in many instances eg:
      <ol>
        <li>During Collaboration</li>
        <li>When fixing errors</li>
        <li>When adding any possible features</li>
        <li>Testing new ideas</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Creating a branch</h3>
      <p class="s-paragraph">Let us now see how to create these branches for better understanding.
        To create a branch, we run
        <code>git branch branch_name</code>
      </p>
      <figure>

    <div>
      <h3>Viewing all branches</h3>
      <p class="s-paragraph">To view the existing branches in a repository, run... <br>
      <span class="code"><code>git branch</code></span><br>
      The starred and green one is the active branch</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Switching active branches</h3>
      <p class="s-paragraph">Now that we have created our branch and made sure it is there, lets move from the main one to out newly made
        branch. To do this, we run <span class="code"><code>git switch branch_name</code></span></p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/switching-branch.png" alt="A screenshot of switching branches" width="600px">
      </figure>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Merging branches</h3>
      <p class="s-paragraph">
        Now that we have made changes to the file, we can now merge it with the original copy. To do this, we run
        <span class="code"><code>git branch branch_name</code></span> <b>Remember</b>, when merging you need to be in the branch you want to
        bring
        changes
        <b>into</b>. Then you use the name of the branch of which you want to bring changes <b>from</b>.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Deleting a branch</h3>
      <p class="s-paragraph">Now that we merged our branches, we can finally delete our created branch without affecting the original
        copy. to do this we run the command <span class="code"><code>git branch -d branch_name</code></span></p>

      <figure>
        <img src="./images/deleting-branch.png" alt="A screenshot of the command to delete a branch" width="600px">

  <div class="next-steps">
    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <p class="m-paragraph">Now that you are done with git, i would recommend learning more related concepts e.g. pull and push requests.
      Understand how to create a repository, how to fork someone else's project, and also remote repositories in
      github. You can also learn about merge conflicts and how to fix them. You can also learn about GitHub pages and
      hosting you sites </p>
