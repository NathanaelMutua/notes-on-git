      <h1>GIT</h1>
      <h2>What is git?</h2>
      <p class="major-paragraph">
        Git is a <b>version control system</b>. A version control sysytem is a tool
        used to track and manage changes over time. A (VCS) is divided into
        two:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Centralized version control system</li>
        <li>Decentralized version control system</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="minor-paragraph">Git is useful to its users in different ways. Its used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track changes</li>
        <li>Collaborate with others on projects</li>
        <li>Revert back to old versions or forms</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Installing git</h3>
      <p class="major-paragraph">
        Let's get practical!<br />
        First, check whether git is already installed in your machine. To do
        this, open your terminal or command prompt from the start menu or from
        searching manually. Then, run <i>git --version</i>. This will tell you
        the version of git you are using. if it doesn't, use this
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">link</a> to
        download git in your machine. Afterwards run the command.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Configuring git</h3>
        <p class="major-paragraph">
          One down, many to go! <br />At this point, i am assuming you already
          have git installed. Now lets have it configured. Let us start with
          the username. To configure the username, run
          <i>git config --global user.name "your preferred username"</i><br />
          To configure your email address, run
          <i>git config --global user.email "your email address"</i><br />
          Confirming whether these two have been configured is very easy. Just
          run: <br />
          For the username <i>git config user.name</i> <br />
          For the email
          <i>git config user.email</i>
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Initializing a git repository</h3>
        <p class="major-paragraph">
          Now that we have git installed and configured with our email and our
          username, lets initialize a git repository. Think of a git
          repository as a <i>folder </i> that we track all of our changes.
          There are two types of a git repo, a local repository and a remote
          repository. A local repository is the one that exists in your
          computer while the remote one is the one online in sites like
          github. <br /><br />Lets initialize. <br />
          Go to the folder you want to have your project and run the terminal.
          <br />
          To initialize a git repo, run <i>git status</i> first to confirm
          there is no existing repository. You should only have one git
          repository for your project. <br />
          Now run <i>git init</i> to initialize a git repository.
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/initializing.png" alt="running git status and git init to initialize a git repo"
            width="600px" />
          <figcaption>
            Initializing a git repository using git init
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="minor-paragraph">
        You can confirm by again running <i>git status</i>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Adding files to the staging area</h3>
        <p class="major-paragraph">
          You are doing amazing! now we need to add files to the staging area.
          Think of the staging area like a waiting room, your code stays there
          waiting to be admitted. To do this, we use
          <i>git add filename</i> eg git add text.txt
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/adding files.png" alt="A screenshot of adding files to the staging area" width="600px" />
          <figcaption>Adding files to the staging area</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="minor-paragraph">
          From the screenshot above, you can see that when we added the .txt
          file it was ready for commit and it was in green, that is a tracked
          file meaning that it is now being monitored by git while the .html file was red until we added it to the
          staging area.When it was red it was an untracked file, meaning git is not monitoring them. You can also
          use
          <i>git add .</i> to shorten the whole process and make it easier.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Commiting changes</h3>
        <p class="major-paragraph">
          We are almost done here. Commiting is like 'saving' the changes you
          added earlier. To commit you need to use
          <i>git commit -m "commit message"</i>. For the 'commit messages'
          should answer, 'What will this commit do?'. For example git commit -m
          "Add our files to..."
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="./images/commiting.png" alt="a screenshot of a commit command in terminal" width="600px" />
          <figcaption>A commit command and the expected result</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          It is also possible to view all of our past commits. We use
          <i>git log</i>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/past-commits.png" alt="a screenshot of all our past commits" width="600px" />

        </figure>
        And just like that we are done with that part!

        <h2>Branches</h2>
        <p>
          In a nutshell, branching helps in creating a copy of a file without
          messing the original file. Branching can be used in many instances eg:
        <ol>
          <li>During Collaboration</li>
          <li>When fixing errors</li>
          <li>When adding any possible features</li>
          <li>Testing new ideas</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Creating a branch</h3>
        <p>Let us now see how to create these branches for better understanding.
          To create a branch, we run
          <i>git branch branch_name</i>
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/creating-branch.png" alt="A snapshot of creating the branch" width="600px">
          <figcaption>Creating a branch</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Viewing all branches</h3>
        <p>To view the existing branches in a repository, run <i>git branch</i>
          The starred and green one is the active branch</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/viewing-branch.png" alt="A screenshot of viewing existing branches" width="600px">
          <figcaption>Viewing branches</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Switching active branches</h3>
        <p>Now that we have created our branch and made sure it is there, lets move from the main one to out newly made
          branch. To do this, we run git switch </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/switching-branch.png" alt="A screenshot of switching branches" width="600px">
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Merging branches</h3>
        <p>
          Now that we have made changes to the file, we can now merge it with the original copy. To do this, we run
          <i>git branch branch_name</i> <b>Remember</b>, when merging you need to be in the branch you want to bring
          changes
          <b>into</b>. Then you use the name of the branch of which you want to bring changes <b>from</b>.
        </p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Deleting a branch</h3>
        <p>Now that we merged our branches, we can finally delete our created branch without affecting the original
          copy. to do this we run the command <code>git branch -d branch_name</code></p>

        <figure>
          <img src="./images/deleting-branch.png" alt="A screenshot of the command to delete a branch" width="600px">

    <div>
      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>Now that you are done with git, i would recommend learning more related concepts e.g. pull and push requests.
        Understand how to create a repository, how to fork someone else's project, and also remote repositories in
        github. You can also learn about merge conflicts and how to fix them. You can also learn about GitHub pages and
        hosting you sites </p>
